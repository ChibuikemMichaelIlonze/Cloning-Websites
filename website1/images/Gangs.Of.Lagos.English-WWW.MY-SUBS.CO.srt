00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,125
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,666
Why are you here?

5
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,250
Sorry, my dear.

6
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,625
Give me the bag.

7
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,708
Hey! Give him the bag.

8
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,625
I'm in trouble.

9
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,625
Please.

10
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,958
Fight!

11
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:17,791
Ah ah

12
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
London, this guy can't do it.

13
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,207
I can do it.

14
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:44,957
Ahn ahn

15
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,582
Money! Money!

16
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,707
- This is the major one.
- This one wants to travel to America.

17
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,707
- Leave it
- What?

18
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,416
She'll probably need it.

19
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,332
We shouldn't throw it away.

20
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:01,458
Ify! Use your brain!
Use your head!

21
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,541
This could get us in trouble.

22
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,416
Are you the boss?

23
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,791
I am the boss.

24
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,875
No! I am the boss.

25
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,625
You who was afraid of that fat woman?

26
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,666
My father was a great king,

27
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,707
You have to listen to what I say.

28
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,291
Okay then,

29
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
If you are the boss,

30
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,625
Teni is my girl.

31
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:27,750
Ahhh

32
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,832
What is it with you guys and this girl?

33
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,291
You're the boss.

34
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,582
Thanks for having my back there.

35
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,332
That woman almost shit her pants.

36
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,625
You're my blood.

37
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,082
No one messes with my blood.

38
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,291
- How about me?
- Chill... You're our bro.

39
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,082
Street brothers for life.

40
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,500
Street brothers for life.

41
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,291
Street brothers forever.

42
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,750
Swear on your life!

43
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,875
Eww!

44
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,750
Am I not a girl?

45
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,500
- Well done.
- Honestly.

46
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,375
PND party,

47
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:40,875
They want 15 local governments

48
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:46,666
To win in the upcoming state primaries.

49
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,750
That's easy, I swear.

50
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,333
You know we got this.

51
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,625
KZ

52
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:20,000
I would like you to give Akinwale
and I a few minutes of privacy.

53
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,375
Chill out.

54
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,332
Baba,

55
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,166
I am tired of this street life, Baba.

56
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,416
Honestly.

57
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,332
I have gathered quite a bit of money.

58
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,875
Baba.

59
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,875
I am ready to start a new business.

60
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:00,708
Akinwale.

61
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,416
I know that you are still a young man

62
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,375
But that does not mean
you should not be wise.

63
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,916
Listen,

64
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,791
don't be deceived by anyone.

65
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,165
Look,

66
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:33,290
Let me tell you,

67
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:44,625
To the kind of life that every aspiring,
young Isale Eko boy is dreaming of.

68
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,083
Listen, even Kazeem can't match you.

69
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,540
You better wise up!

70
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,250
What is wrong with you?

71
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,541
Can you imagine that?

72
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,541
Take it easy.

73
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,500
Thank you.

74
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,916
Madam.

75
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,125
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,208
You said your bag was stolen.

77
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,750
If this happened in Isale Eko,
like you said, then relax.

78
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, sir.

79
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,875
Terrible!

80
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,625
Here's the bag. We found it.

81
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,000
That's him! That's him!

82
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,790
Woman, relax!

83
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm sorry, sir

84
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Get up.

85
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,083
Child of God.

86
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,583
What's your name?

87
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,791
There were two of them, sir.

88
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,750
The other one ran...
Where's your friend?!

89
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,416
What? I'll slap you so hard you'll...

90
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,625
Terrible

91
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,833
Baba.

92
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,208
It was just me, sir.

93
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,833
My name is Akande...

94
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,208
Really? Obalola?

95
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,916
How is that?

96
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,958
Who is your father?
Are you the son of a dead King?

97
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,875
Yes, sir.

98
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,333
- You're Ogunmola's son?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,291
Come closer.

100
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,708
Can't be true.

101
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,375
You are your father's son.

102
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,333
Look,

103
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,958
You know what we'll do?

104
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,540
You see,

105
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,290
You'll return the bag to her

106
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,083
because you don't bring harm
to your own people.

107
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,708
You understand?

108
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,416
Yes, Sir.

109
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,916
But...
she has gone to the cops.

110
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:06,791
Madam,

111
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,458
The police?

112
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,500
I just had to formally report
my missing passport.

113
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,208
Enough! No need to explain at all.

114
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,916
You see the police you reported to?

115
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,375
You'll go back to them

116
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,083
and they will help you
find your missing bag.

117
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,625
Oh! I have upset you?

118
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,915
Terrible!

119
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,125
Obalola!

120
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,208
Teni.

121
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,375
Teniola!
Put your head back in!

122
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,125
Obalola!

123
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,750
Obasco!

124
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,833
Smart boy.

125
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,125
You've made a lot of money today.

126
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,208
Sir?

127
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,375
You can’t play smart with me…

128
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,791
I’ll just throw you a punch

129
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:28,000
Look at me.
I know you didn’t steal the bag alone.

130
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,291
You’re just protecting your friend, right?

131
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,958
Omo aiye never brings harm to his own.

132
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:41,000
So, what police station did
you see her enter?

133
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,583
So, how did you know
she went to the police?

134
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:59,375
Obasco!
You’re no ordinary boy.

135
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,416
I see now that
you’re truly your fathers son.

136
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,083
- Yes, sir.
- Wonderful...

137
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,875
but I need you to listen.

138
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,666
Thank you so much.

139
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,125
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.

140
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,875
What?

141
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
Thank you.

142
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,750
Well played boy.

143
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:41,500
If you need anything,
ask for Ninalowo on Ricca street.

144
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,915
- Ricca Street?
- Yes.

145
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,833
That's where Teni lives.

146
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,083
Kazeem’s daughter?

147
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,500
I noticed you staring at her.

148
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,290
They live next door.

149
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,625
Thank you, sir.

150
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,833
What are you doing here?!

151
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,791
Take your evil money and leave my son!

152
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,708
Madam, I was just talk…

153
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,958
Don't speak to me!
I don’t want to hear your voice!

154
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,666
What did I do to you this child?

155
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:21,250
Why do you want to ruin me?

156
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,000
But I won’t let you!
I won’t let the devil take your soul!

157
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,708
Do you hear me?
You know what?

158
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,333
We are going to the aladura!

159
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,750
No! Mummy please!

160
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,750
- Don’t let me slap you! Let’s go!
- Mummy please!

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Mummy please!

162
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,665
My darling…

163
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,250
You know I’m doing all this for you.

164
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,833
I'm doing it so the evil spirits
in you can leave.

165
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,166
So I can rest knowing you will
live long and be prosperous.

166
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,250
Be strong...

167
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:14,666
The pain shows that God is working in you.

168
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,250
It is a sign that the battle is won.

169
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Obalola,

170
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,625
I wasn’t expecting you so soon.

171
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,915
I’m looking for a place to stay.

172
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,583
Who did this to you?

173
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,040
Come… Come in

174
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,916
Do we have a guest?

175
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,916
We have a son.

176
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,333
Obalola, come in.

177
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,333
Obasco,

178
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,750
All of this is yours.

179
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:57,291
I want you to sleep well tonight.

180
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,458
Don't worry about anything.

181
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,708
We'll talk tomorrow. All right?

182
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,291
Smart boy.

183
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,750
Obalola!

184
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,708
Obalola.

185
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,666
Oba.

186
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,541
- Bring my son.
- What child?

187
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,541
Evil woman! How do you treat
your own child like that?

188
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,291
Go in and bring my son.

189
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,583
Face me. Leave the small boy alone.

190
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,666
- Who's making all that noise?
- What are you going to do?

191
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,791
Princess, come in. Come in.

192
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,333
- Look, bring me my child.
- What child?

193
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,750
I know you’re hiding him,
so just go in and bring him to…

194
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,875
Oh, my Akani, My darling. Thank God.

195
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,000
Come, come let’s go.

196
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,458
I’m not leaving.

197
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,833
Leave these evil people, let’s go home!

198
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,500
I’m not leaving.

199
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,125
You have to leave the boy

200
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:53,708
The boy says he’s not leaving.
I dare you to step a foot in this house!

201
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,750
You are not leaving.

202
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,041
It is not a curse.

203
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,250
You see this path your father took

204
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,166
this is the same path your father took
with these evil people,

205
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,791
these criminals...

206
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,250
This is the same path you want to follow.

207
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,125
This path?

208
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,291
Will lead to your death.

209
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,375
Enough!

210
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:35,000
Never will you speak to this boy
in that way again!

211
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,750
Have you ever been to a house like this?

212
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:58,958
This is where rich and
important people live.

213
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:04,041
One day,
we would live in a place like this.

214
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,458
They don’t have two heads, right?

215
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,708
Akinwale

216
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,416
How are you?

217
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,500
You wait here.

218
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,041
I'll be back.

219
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,458
Obasco!

220
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,250
Oba!

221
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,250
Oba!

222
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,833
I want you to wait for me in the car.

223
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,333
Whatever you do, don't leave this car.

224
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,708
They didn’t tell me anything!

225
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,666
Stop screaming.

226
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,041
- Please.
- Shhhh.

227
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,958
Listen,

228
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,583
I can keep cutting you from now
till the sun comes up.

229
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,750
I won’t even get bored.

230
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,458
Listen, you will pray for death
but you won't find it.

231
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,666
You won't die till I'm ready to kill you.

232
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,416
My ear!

233
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,833
Obalola!

234
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,541
I told you to wait in the car!

235
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,416
Nino, you brought a child here.

236
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,333
I couldn't leave him alone at home.

237
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,208
It's all good.

238
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:45,625
Looks like the kid
has the stomach for this.

239
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:51,875
Holding a knife to that child's neck?

240
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:59,291
The dead king’s son.
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

241
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,708
Look, he was born for this life.

242
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,708
No one is born for this life.

243
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:53,375
It's been 7 days...
No one one has seen her.

244
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,166
We have given the police all our savings,

245
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,708
but they are too scared
to go and search that place.

246
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:04,208
Please help me.

247
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:07,125
That man promised her
that he will take her to London,

248
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,291
But we have heard that he uses
people to smuggle drugs.

249
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,500
Please help me.

250
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,125
You should have come to me earlier.

251
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,750
I didn’t know better.

252
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,458
I know London very well.

253
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,916
If your daughter is with him,
I'll get her out.

254
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:41,958
London!

255
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,625
London!

256
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:45,916
Where are you?!

257
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,458
Who’s the mad man
barking like a dog in my club?

258
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,875
You're talking to Ninalowo

259
00:25:54,958 --> 00:26:00,791
The girl in this picture,
she's my child, and I heard you have her.

260
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,166
Yes, she is here.

261
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,041
The girl in the picture
and all the other girls here,

262
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,500
they’re all bought and paid for.

263
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,666
Not this girl.

264
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,708
Listen

265
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,000
You can look out your windows
if you please,

266
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,500
I came with an army.

267
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,375
I either leave with the girl,
or we all die here tonight.

268
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,833
- Arrow.
- Baba.

269
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:35,750
Go get the whore so these
bastards can get the hell out of here.

270
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,541
London... till we meet again

271
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,958
You know what that means, right?

272
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:59,500
Get out of my club!

273
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,083
and you, knockoff white man.

274
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,083
Fuck shit up.

275
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,791
You?

276
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,541
So you don't believe me?

277
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,291
Never!

278
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,000
For me?

279
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:19,583
Look at me, Look at me.

280
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,250
Obasco!

281
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,708
Are you enjoying your food?

282
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,000
Well done. I’ll see you later.

283
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,625
Yes Sir

284
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,750
Smart child.

285
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,583
Goodbye.

286
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,500
Take it easy.

287
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,833
Nice guy.

288
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,625
Mama, we protect you.

289
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,708
- Omo ibo, you are back.
- Mama, we protect you.

290
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,166
You don't have...
Anyone, just give it to me.

291
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,791
What is it?!
Money, money, money every time!

292
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,875
- Pay up.
- You like money.

293
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,583
Hey, look who it is.

294
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,666
- Mummy.
- Ify.

295
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,000
Mummy.

296
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,958
What did you just do?

297
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,416
Ify Collector!

298
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,666
How are you?

299
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,541
- What?

300
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,250
- That's Kazeem.
Don't let him hear you call me that.

301
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,833
That was in his time.

302
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,875
This is your own time now.

303
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,083
You’re the boss now.

304
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,166
Let me give you some corn?

305
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,500
Leave the corn,
I’m here for Kazeem’s money.

306
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,000
- Really? How are you?
- Yes, mummy. I'm fine.

307
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,625
Mama Nkechi… come…

308
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,333
This is Mama Nkechi

309
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,833
Yes.

310
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,041
She doesn't have the money for this month.

311
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,041
Ha!

312
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:40,625
Relax,

313
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,041
she will pay you next month.

314
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,375
I guarantee you.

315
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,625
I know but Kazeem
doesn't want to hear stories.

316
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,375
The elections are here and
he's not being merciful.

317
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,833
That man is too greedy.

318
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,000
Mummy, be careful what you say.
The walls have ears.

319
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,708
But it's true...

320
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,958
if he and Olorogun collect everything,

321
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,666
What will the rest of us eat?

322
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,916
But Kazeem provides protection.

323
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,291
What protection?!

324
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,958
My son protects me!

325
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:11,375
You will protect me. Ify the collector.

326
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,375
Collector, protector!

327
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,666
- Mummy, I know what you're doing...
- It is working...

328
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,458
Where is Wemimo?

329
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,750
Aren't these Kazeem's boys?
There's trouble!

330
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,958
Lunatics!

331
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,000
Wemimo,

332
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,583
If you don't come out right away,
I'll blow your head off.

333
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,625
Please. My brother, please.

334
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,458
Brother Wemimo, hope all is well.

335
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:53,958
Don't you dare!

336
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,875
Everything is fine.

337
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,791
Bring the money.

338
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,291
Count it! Is it complete?

339
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,041
- It is complete.
- That's a good boy.

340
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,541
How much?

341
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,000
Do you want to be unfortunate?

342
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,791
Get out of the car!

343
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,333
I'll kill you.

344
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,041
Please have mercy. It was the devil

345
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,708
When you meet the devil,
you can explain that to him.

346
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,625
What's up?

347
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,791
Please, have mercy.

348
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,291
- Alaye.
- Eruku.

349
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,416
Please, have mercy

350
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,791
Please… please

351
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,791
I’m finished!

352
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:52,625
We’ve had enough.
We’re done. We don’t want you any longer.

353
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,500
This is not a monarchy.

354
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,583
Why can’t they use their children?

355
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,750
They keep their kids abroad.

356
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,375
Why?

357
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,291
She’s all talk. Don't be bothered.

358
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,083
We own the streets.

359
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,500
Wemimo, Wemimo!

360
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,750
Is that you?

361
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,458
How are you?

362
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,000
Come on… don’t be sacred.

363
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,166
Relax, feel at home.

364
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,458
Come sit.

365
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,000
Sit.

366
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,791
Wemimo. Wemimo. Relax.

367
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:03,750
Come closer. Don’t be shy.

368
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:12,166
You cannot steal from my collections.

369
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,583
And then you suddenly lose your voice.

370
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:24,583
Actually, sir...
It was a miscalculation...

371
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,791
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,250
A miscalculation?

373
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:32,000
You know what?
I'm inclined to believe you.

374
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,375
A miscalculation

375
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:35,958
Yes, sir.

376
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:43,166
But you know I have eyes and ears
everywhere.

377
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,250
Mr. Man, go inside!

378
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,250
Wemimo, Wemimo!

379
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,791
I’m finished!

380
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,375
I’m finished!

381
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
How’s it going?

382
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,500
- Have they come for their meat?
- No they haven't.

383
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
They haven’t come.

384
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,541
Come this way!

385
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,333
Please, sir.

386
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,916
Please.

387
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,916
- Wemimo.
- Sir.

388
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,583
Do you still maintain
that it was a miscalculation?

389
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,500
I’ll confess.

390
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,083
- I did it.
- You did it?

391
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,083
I did it.

392
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,333
But, sir, it wasn't me.
It was an evil spirit. It was madness.

393
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,000
An evil spirit.

394
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,208
A miscalculation…

395
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,833
I'm a butcher's son.

396
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,833
I have been butchering both animals
and humans since I was a child.

397
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:18,041
Next time when someone
sends you to steal from me.

398
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,375
You either kill them yourselves,

399
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,250
Or...

400
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,583
In the words of Jesus Christ,

401
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,083
bring them to me.

402
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,416
Obasco!

403
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:00,833
Sir.

404
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,208
Well done.

405
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,208
Your friend is coming back.

406
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,416
- Teni?
- Yes.

407
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:17,083
You see, this election is
going to get really tough.

408
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,333
It will get really tough.

409
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:26,375
I told her not to come home
but the girl is too stubborn.

410
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,666
That's Teni.

411
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:33,500
I’ve found her a job on the Island,
a friend of mine offered her a job.

412
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,750
So I've bought her a flat.

413
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,250
But...

414
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:47,500
I want you to be her personal bodyguard
and her security person.

415
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,416
Nothing can happen to Teni,
she's all I have.

416
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,250
Nothing will happen to her.

417
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,083
I trust you.
That's why I chose you.

418
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,333
Take this.

419
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,958
Who should I give it to?

420
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,250
It’s yours.

421
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,625
For what?

422
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,125
Use it to take care of yourself.

423
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,375
This is too much.

424
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,541
Come on.

425
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,708
You’re like a son to me.

426
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,875
Ninalowo’s son is my son.

427
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,791
So if I don’t take care of you, who will?

428
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,541
Obasco!

429
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Fifty thousand Naira.

430
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,000
I just need to raise the funds.

431
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,000
I hear you want to talk?

432
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,250
- That's right.
- Go on.

433
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,291
I have a bulk shipment of coke and you’re
the only one I trust to deal with it.

434
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:57,708
Have you guys lost your minds?!
In my hood?!

435
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,291
In my hood!

436
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,791
- Have you lost your minds?
- Kashope!

437
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,166
- Calm down.
- Oba!

438
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,125
Take my name out of your mouth.

439
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,333
- Calm down!
- Have you lost your mind?

440
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,625
It seems you have lost your mind!

441
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,041
I'll hit you with...

442
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,375
Hands up!

443
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:23,541
Calm down.
Bringing a gun to a knife fight?

444
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,333
Relax!
Relax!

445
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,958
Bar man, for the damage…

446
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,125
I dare you to try me.

447
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,041
Calm down! What if you shoot and miss?!

448
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,750
You’ll just die for nothing. Try me.

449
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,083
See his head like a goat's head.

450
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,208
Why don't you say it in Yoruba? Bastard.

451
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,416
He said your head looks
like that of a goat.

452
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,416
Filthy witch!

453
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,416
Demon!

454
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,375
- I’ll smash your head in.
- I’ll mess you up!

455
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,791
We should have beaten Kashope.
He’s such an idiot!

456
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,375
Your house or your mother’s house?

457
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,708
She won’t do anything…

458
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,250
Ifeanyi!

459
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,625
Ifeanyi, so you’re here.
Look at this Bastard.

460
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,875
I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

461
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,541
Who is this?

462
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,416
You better run.
He’ll get you pregnant then disappear!

463
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,291
Ifeanyi, you!

464
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,208
You did this to me, Ifeanyi

465
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,458
What exactly do you want to explain?

466
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,958
How you didn't show up at the hospital?

467
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:42,916
You then sent your stupid friend
to bring me 50,000 Naira.

468
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:49,291
Worthless money. 50,000 Naira.
How dare you?!

469
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,375
I was scared. A baby is a lot.

470
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,750
A baby is a lot?

471
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,875
Blessing!

472
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,666
What sort of rubbish talk is that?

473
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,625
Do you know where I live?

474
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,750
Do you know where I sleep?

475
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,708
Do you know where your child...
Leave me alone!

476
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,250
My landlord kicked me and your baby out.

477
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:15,583
I sIept in the streets for two days.

478
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:18,291
It won't be well with you.

479
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,333
Blessing look at me. Calm down

480
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,958
Take us to where you're staying.

481
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,416
You're moving out tonight.

482
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,791
Ify will do right by you.

483
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,125
Even if I have to break his head.

484
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:43,250
Do you hear me?

485
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,375
I swear to God, I will.
To God who made me.

486
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:51,666
Why didn’t you swear in Satan’s name.
You stupid idiot.

487
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:54,666
No need to kick a man
when he’s already down.

488
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,625
I hope this doesn't
land you in trouble someday.

489
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,083
Nonsense person.

490
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,958
My boy! My Boy!

491
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:37,208
Just look at how handsome my boy is.

492
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:41,666
Look at his perfect little nose!

493
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,458
We will name him

494
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:53,625
after your father,

495
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:58,416
Ikechukwu David.

496
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,875
Yes! Just like his father!

497
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,375
Like his mother too.

498
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,833
So, you see my boy...

499
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,708
He will cause problems.

500
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,291
Listen, babe...

501
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:38,666
Once my music blows up,
I’m going to marry you.

502
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:42,333
Lies!

503
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:48,541
- See, I swear...
- Shut up over there and stop swearing!

504
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:54,125
Even your mum knows you're lying.

505
00:52:57,166 --> 00:53:04,458
Guys, I'll never forget what
you guys did for me this night.

506
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,375
- Are you teasing me?
- I'm not.

507
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,375
Street brothers for life.

508
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:13,833
That's disgusting!

509
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:34,708
Obalola!

510
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,708
Teni.

511
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,500
Are you going to let go of each other?
Are you bound?

512
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,833
They’re acting like in an Indian film.

513
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,291
Is this really you?

514
00:53:56,125 --> 00:54:00,541
It’s been ten years.
Are you sure you went to America?

515
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:02,208
Where’s the accent?

516
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,458
What silly accent?

517
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,541
I'm just an Isale Eko girl.

518
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,333
- Ebun!
- Eruku!

519
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,458
I’m loyal!

520
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:18,458
You’re so local!
Are you sure you went to the real America?

521
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,166
I’m local and proud!

522
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:21,666
Igbo boy!

523
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:22,750
My crush.

524
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,041
- My sugar Banana.
- My boo.

525
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:25,750
My baby boo boo.

526
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,833
Igbo boy.

527
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,000
- Igbo boy.
- My boo.

528
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,458
What are you wearing?

529
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,416
He’s a baby daddy now.

530
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,458
What happened?

531
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:43,916
I have so much to tell you, you won’t
believe what happened with this boy.

532
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:44,958
Obasco!

533
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:46,875
Sir.

534
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:49,625
Tenilola.

535
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,000
Look who is talking.
Don't you know you are all grown up too.

536
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:01,375
- Good morning.
- Oba.

537
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,750
Good morning. How are you?

538
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,250
Remember the house I told you
I bought for Teni?

539
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,791
That’s where you’ll take her.
I’ve sent you the address.

540
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,833
I have it.

541
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,458
She’s the apple of my eye.

542
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,166
- Do you hear me?
- I’ll take care of her.

543
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,208
I trust you.

544
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:25,958
Bye, daddy.

545
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,875
The both of you are going to
run an errand for me.

546
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,375
Come on, let’s go!

547
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,041
Igbo boy… You’re with me.

548
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,416
Let's go.

549
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,375
Yes, Sir.

550
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,583
Why do you always dress like a man?

551
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,875
Why does your mouth stink so bad?

552
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,125
Just because I joke around with you?

553
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,208
Don't do that with me.

554
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,000
You better ask why they call me Terrible.

555
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,833
I’m warning you.

556
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,166
You are probably sleeping with Eleniyan.

557
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,625
So he asked you to join us.

558
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,125
This job we’re going for
isn’t child’s play.

559
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:28,500
You need to be smart!

560
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:47,000
Wait…

561
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,291
How many people will live in here?

562
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,250
Don't be silly. I know it's big.

563
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,041
It even has a balcony.

564
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,000
Teni, do you really own this house?

565
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,000
Technically, it’s my dad’s
but he bought it in my name.

566
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:31,958
It won't be well with the person
that killed my father.

567
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,208
I should go with you!

568
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:07,083
Who will stay on the look out
if you come with us?

569
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:12,500
Look, just because the boss
trusts you, doesn’t mean I do.

570
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,083
Let’s move!

571
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,125
Ify, I have some good news for you.

572
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,375
Yes.

573
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:05,791
Remember that producer you’ve
been wanting to work with?

574
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:12,041
I’ve spoken to him and he says you should
come and perform for him this weekend.

575
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:19,250
That's enough. Don't prostrate
whilst you're driving.

576
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,708
Look where you're going.

577
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,541
Thank you, sir.

578
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,416
I won't disappoint you.

579
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,416
You wouldn’t dare.

580
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,541
Panama.

581
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:02,750
Alaye.

582
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Eleniyan.

583
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,166
Good afternoon, Sir

584
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:31,833
How are you?

585
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:32,833
We’re fine, sir.

586
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,208
Boys! Pack up!

587
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,541
You’ve already cut off my hair.

588
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,791
What’s going on?
I’ve been waiting for over 30mins.

589
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,958
You haven’t even done my friction

590
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:50,583
I said get the fuck out of here!
We’re closed!

591
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Sorry about that, sir.

592
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,708
Now you leave.

593
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,250
I knew my eyes weren’t deceiving me.

594
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,291
It's been 16 years.

595
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,416
But you’re a coward.

596
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:20,583
We could have met anywhere.
Why would you choose to ambush me here?

597
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,875
Wherever we are is
where the battle is fought.

598
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,041
Or have you forgotten my promise
that we would meet again?

599
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:32,458
If you weren’t a coward,
we wouldn’t be meeting here.

600
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:38,458
You know you’re no match for me
so you ambush me here.

601
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:41,208
Only traitors have something to fear.

602
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,791
If you’ve done nothing,
you have nothing to fear.

603
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:56,791
Your loyalties are misplaced.
Olorogun will betray you.

604
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,791
And you will betray the hand that fed you?

605
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:03,375
Tajudeen, for what?

606
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:07,208
For this ordinary woman?
Someone that is going nowhere?

607
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,375
Isn’t it time Olorogun’s reign ended?

608
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:14,250
After over 20 years of ruling over Lagos.

609
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,375
His time is up! He should leave.

610
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,833
Such a pity. You have forgotten.

611
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:27,416
You’ve forgotten that you were
roaming the streets

612
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,791
like a mad man.

613
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,125
High off your mind on all sorts of drugs.

614
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:41,166
Then Olorogun found you,

615
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,041
took mercy on your wretched soul
and changed your life.

616
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:53,041
Now you think you can meddle
in the affairs of Lagos?

617
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,916
Shut the fuck up!

618
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:01,916
Where the fuck are you from anywhere?

619
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:11,625
You bastard with no pedigree.
I was born here in Lagos Island,

620
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,375
My family house is on Campos street.

621
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:20,666
Who the hell is your father,
you fucking bastard?!

622
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,041
- Why are you running?
- I'll still get you.

623
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:59,125
You are running. You are mad.

624
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,625
Pick it up.

625
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,166
It's Pana.
I'll call him back.

626
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,916
I remember the day you
moved into Nino's house.

627
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,500
I remember too.

628
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:39,208
I was going through so much back then.

629
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:47,666
But then I saw you…
and my mind felt at ease.

630
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:54,375
So... you liked me that much?

631
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,333
Are you messing with me?

632
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,500
You knew I liked you.

633
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:04,750
But you’re ahead now.

634
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:10,666
I'm sure you met big guys in America.

635
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:16,708
Guys that went to University,

636
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:23,125
Not guys like us that didn't
finish secondary school.

637
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:31,416
None of that really matters.

638
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,333
What education does he have?

639
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,541
Really? What education does he have?

640
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,541
What happened to you?

641
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:59,833
You used to be all about going to school.

642
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:08,708
All to what end?
Power is what really matters.

643
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:10,666
Power.

644
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:15,125
A million and one people

645
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,791
willing to die

646
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,458
for a cause they know
absolutely nothing about.

647
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,000
Power.

648
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,625
How do you wield this power?

649
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:30,791
Eruku.

650
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,208
Exactly

651
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:39,666
Girl, You've changed a lot!

652
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:44,083
Really? I thought you said
I was the same Teni from Isale Eko

653
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:46,291
Nah, I was foolish to think that.

654
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,625
You're your father's daughter.

655
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,500
Wait here for Eleniyan.

656
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:23,500
Ify.

657
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,000
How are you?

658
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,625
Well done.

659
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,916
You impressed me yesterday.
You made me proud.

660
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,541
You held your own as a man should.

661
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,750
Yes, sir.

662
01:08:41,957 --> 01:08:44,500
There’s something I need you to do.

663
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,332
What is that?

664
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,291
You’ve heard the news.

665
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,375
Yes, sir.

666
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:56,791
So you know we can't have anyone talking.

667
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:58,707
Sir... I would never.

668
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:03,500
You?! Oh, I wasn't worried about you.

669
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:11,166
But... The barber.
I need you to take care of him

670
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:13,832
I don’t understand, sir.

671
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:18,332
What don't you understand?
Take care of him.

672
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:26,832
Make sure he can never utter a word again.

673
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:33,750
When you’re done, come to the club
so you can perform for the producer.

674
01:09:35,207 --> 01:09:37,250
- Tonight, Sir?
- Of course.

675
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,082
You’re not ready?

676
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:42,166
No, sir. I’m ready

677
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:46,000
When you’re done,
come and meet me at the club.

678
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:47,500
Thank you, sir.

679
01:09:50,957 --> 01:09:53,791
Listen, no need to thank family.

680
01:09:55,833 --> 01:10:00,875
I take care of my own,

681
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:07,333
and I expect loyalty

682
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:11,583
in return.

683
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:42,041
Who is that?

684
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,041
Guy, I've been calling you
since yesterday night.

685
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:45,958
Where were you?

686
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,375
You want to spoil my door.
I was driving Teni around.

687
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,625
Kazeem killed London.

688
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,791
What?

689
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,250
I swear, the barbershop, the fat guy.

690
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:55,791
BJ?

691
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:59,750
Yes. So we get to shop and
I think Kazeem wants a haircut.

692
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:03,458
Next thing you know, London is reading
a newspaper, one person says something,

693
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,541
and before you know it,
Kazeem just shot the guy.

694
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:08,875
Maybe Olorogun ordered it.

695
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,125
It’s already on the news.

696
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:37,125
I'm a Lagosian. I was born here.

697
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,750
Same night he arranges
for me to meet the producer.

698
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,041
Kazeem?

699
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,958
Keep up! Yes, Kazeem.

700
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,458
Calm down!

701
01:11:57,208 --> 01:12:02,583
How can I calm down?
As we were leaving, I saw Kash.

702
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,083
He saw me.

703
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,166
Don't worry, Kash is Ekun's son…

704
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,166
Even though he's a fucking traitor,
Ekun will not touch Nino's son.

705
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:14,208
And they know you can't kill a Capo...
when you're not mad.

706
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,125
Look lay low till tonight.
We'll go together to the barber.

707
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:24,125
Will you kill him?

708
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:27,083
Oba, I talk a lot of shit
but I’ve never killed before...

709
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:31,583
Calm down! We're not killing anyone.
Unless he's being unreasonable.

710
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,541
We'll convince the barber to leave Lagos.
For his own good.

711
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,500
Then tomorrow morning,
we'll go and see Ekun.

712
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,083
Stop shaking. Take your phone.

713
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:31,875
- What’s up?
- You should come with us.

714
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,875
To do what?

715
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,375
I’ll bring you something.

716
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,958
Teni, please don’t stay too long.

717
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:42,458
I've heard you.

718
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,291
Hello Pana.

719
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,250
Where are you? I have eyes on BJ.

720
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,416
Fuck!

721
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:06,750
Pana, don’t do anything till I get there.
Just wait for me. Wait!

722
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:34,541
Pana where are you? He’s here!

723
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,583
Really? I’ll be there soon.

724
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,541
Make it fast.

725
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,833
I'll call you.

726
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,791
Teni, get in the car!

727
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,708
Why are you raising your voice at me?

728
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:56,208
I don’t have time for this,
get in the car now!

729
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,208
Oba,

730
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:12,666
what's the problem?
What have I done to you?

731
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,291
Not everything is about you Teni.

732
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:19,375
Well, something is wrong
and instead of sulking around,

733
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,083
let’s talk about it.

734
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:32,666
Really? You want to talk?

735
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:34,750
Okay, let’s talk.

736
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:39,125
Let's talk about how your father
has all of us in the streets,

737
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,333
collecting from everyone,

738
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:50,000
no matter how little they have,
so you guys can live like kings.

739
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,708
Have you seen how big your flat is?

740
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:56,083
It’s big enough for 30 people!

741
01:15:57,583 --> 01:15:59,208
You want us to talk right?

742
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:00,375
Let's talk!

743
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:06,208
Let's talk about how your father sends
young boys, barely teenagers,

744
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,458
to die everyday on the streets.

745
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:09,666
For what?!

746
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,333
So your family can have power!

747
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,916
You sit there comfortably in the back
and watch me drive you everyday.

748
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,083
Me, Obalola Akande.

749
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:28,500
You're okay with me being your driver
and security, right?

750
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,958
I don't have hopes and dreams, right?

751
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:38,875
My friends... people I love,
who's going to protect them?

752
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:45,625
Oba...
I didn't ask for this life.

753
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,833
You didn't ask for this life?

754
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:52,291
Oh, but I did?

755
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,916
Rubbish talk.

756
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,750
Oba!

757
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:35,458
Risi, is that you?

758
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:41,000
Did you forget something?

759
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,208
Do you remember my face?

760
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,833
Please.

761
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,791
I've done everything you've asked me to.

762
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,958
Kazeem said I would be a protected man.

763
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:21,333
Thank you! Thank you very much!

764
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:26,833
Look, the kind of shit you’re in,
the people looking to kill you,

765
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:31,041
if you’re ever seen again,

766
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:35,291
you and everyone you care about
will be hunted down and killed.

767
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:44,416
I swear to you, I’ll disappear.
You’ll never see me again.

768
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,375
Teni!

769
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:57,958
Teni!

770
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,291
Teni!

771
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:07,625
Teni!

772
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:10,958
Teni! Don't be scared.

773
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:13,458
Hey, calm the fuck down!

774
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,250
Leave her, take me instead.

775
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:17,666
Who the fuck are you?!

776
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,666
Touch me one more fucking time,

777
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,250
I'll shoot your head off.

778
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:06,458
Gift.

779
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,375
Where are you?
They’re calling your name.

780
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:12,541
Welcome on stage, Panama!

781
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,916
- Panama!
- Pana!

782
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,541
- Pana!
- Where is Panama?

783
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:25,958
Panama, where are you?

784
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,916
DJ play some music!

785
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,916
Put your gun down or we’ll shoot your guy

786
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:42,250
Teni, don’t listen!

787
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:20,416
Sorry.

788
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,333
It’s nothing.

789
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:34,166
Let me take a look at it.

790
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,291
I'm so sorry.

791
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:03,375
- I’m so sorry. I’m so stupid.
- Teni...

792
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,916
I should be apologising.

793
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:10,333
If I hadn’t been talking all that shit,

794
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,666
I wouldn’t have gotten distracted.

795
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:18,208
If anything had happened to you,

796
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,541
I would have...

797
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,333
Pana!

798
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,125
Pana!

799
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,041
Pana!

800
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,333
Ify!

801
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:55,833
Ify!

802
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,125
Ify!

803
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,916
Ify!

804
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,958
Oba, pick up your fucking phone!

805
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,208
Pana!

806
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,625
Pana!

807
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,083
Ify!

808
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,833
Ify!

809
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,625
What do you think they would say?

810
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:06,916
It’s Gift and Pana you should worry
about, they would so make fun of us.

811
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,875
What is it?

812
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,750
What's the matter?

813
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:21,250
Oba, say something. What's the matter?

814
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:32,583
Gift, where’s Pana?

815
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:16,791
Where were you? Where the fuck were you?!

816
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:20,208
You were supposed to be with him?
Where the fuck did you go?!

817
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:26,166
He was all alone.

818
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,958
He was all alone.

819
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,708
They killed my son...

820
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:00,875
When they killed his father,

821
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:03,916
I didn’t complain,

822
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,666
I accepted it.

823
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:11,583
I accepted it.

824
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,041
I accepted it.

825
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,583
Who am I to question God?

826
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,875
Who am I?

827
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:30,958
But you see...

828
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,541
This one, I will not accept.

829
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:39,250
I will not accept.

830
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,833
Look at my son’s face! Look at him!

831
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:50,958
They wanted to cover the coffin
but I refused.

832
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,875
All of you must use your eyes to
see what they did to my son!

833
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,375
My own child.

834
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,166
The God who fights for me.

835
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:09,000
The God who conquers all my battles.

836
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:12,083
The God who listens and answers me.

837
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,833
The God who wages war
against those in battle with me.

838
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:19,041
Arise and fight for me. The time is now!

839
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:22,500
For all those involved in my son's death!

840
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,916
They shall fall one after the other.

841
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:29,916
For one scar, 10 men shall fall.

842
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,916
For one scar, 10 men shall fall.

843
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:35,916
Isale Eko must not know peace.

844
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:37,916
I said it!

845
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:45,333
Isale Eko must not know peace
until the wrath of God is felt!

846
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:55,958
Ifeanyichukwu, show no mercy…

847
01:30:56,041 --> 01:31:01,125
Ifeanyichukwu, show no mercy…

848
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:13,333
My God... The apple of my eye.

849
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,666
Show no mercy.

850
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,958
Kash!

851
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:19,833
Ekun!

852
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:23,333
If you know you're men, come out here.

853
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:26,291
Come and finish what you started.

854
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:30,166
I hear a dog barking.

855
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:32,541
I’m here.

856
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:33,750
On our turf.

857
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:34,875
Come and finish what you started.

858
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,291
You’re a fool.

859
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:38,791
Boys, show no mercy!

860
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,583
I can see you’re ready to meet your maker.

861
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:07,708
You’re a tough guy, right?
You smell like death.

862
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,041
You smell like death.

863
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:11,250
I’m ready to die,
but I’m taking you with me.

864
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,708
No need for weapons,
I’ll kill you with my bare hands.

865
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:14,750
Let’s go!

866
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:15,958
It seems you are unfortunate.

867
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,458
You!

868
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:38,916
You!

869
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:40,333
You!

870
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:47,500
Help me take off my chain.

871
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:54,125
- You broke my ice!
- You can't stand me.

872
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:11,208
Bloodclat!

873
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:59,083
Bruce Lee! You need to calm down!

874
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:09,291
You godforsaken traitors. How could you?

875
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,666
How could you kill one of Nino's children?

876
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,125
Really?

877
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:16,916
Where did you hear that I killed him?

878
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:22,666
You’re going to pretend you didn’t
see Pana outside the barber's shop?

879
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,708
Cowards.

880
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:32,416
You couldn't get to Kazeem,
so you killed him.

881
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:34,833
Pana. Harmless Pana.

882
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:36,250
Are you dumb?

883
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,500
Is your brain empty?

884
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:42,750
This from you.

885
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,041
Oba, this from you?

886
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:53,458
When you were a child Nino used
to tell us all how intelligent you were.

887
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:56,291
That you were smart beyond your years...

888
01:36:57,708 --> 01:37:02,541
Looks like the hot sun
has burnt off your brain.

889
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:08,958
- Don't take me for a fool. I'm not one.
- Really?

890
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:11,166
London was the head of your gang.

891
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:14,791
This was payback.

892
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:19,833
You're being childish. You're not smart.

893
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:25,708
Use your head.
Use your head.

894
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,250
Who killed London?

895
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:31,583
Eleniyan

896
01:37:32,791 --> 01:37:36,208
Who sent Ify to kill Bolaji the barber?

897
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:40,375
How do you know about that?

898
01:37:40,458 --> 01:37:41,708
Answer my question.

899
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:45,208
Eleniyan.

900
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,666
Now we’re getting somewhere.

901
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,291
Let me tell you how it went down.

902
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:55,875
When we eventually found the barber.

903
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,583
He told us all that happened on that day.

904
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,416
I went to Olorogun and insisted he
sanctioned Kazeem's death.

905
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:08,541
Olorogun called us to a meeting.

906
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:14,166
Kazeem said it was London
who drew his gun first.

907
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:17,750
He said Ifeanyi panicked and shot London.

908
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,250
I knew they were lying.

909
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:25,166
But it was obvious they had determined
to make Ifeanyi take the fall.

910
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:32,916
You enemy is closer to you than you know.

911
01:38:37,958 --> 01:38:40,166
You know how these things
happen on the streets.

912
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,333
And eye for an eye.
Blood for blood.

913
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:46,083
They agreed for Terrible
would kill Ifeanyi.

914
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:50,291
But if they failed to do so,
we would capture Teni.

915
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,791
Why do you think we let you go that night?

916
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:56,416
You thought an angel intervened?

917
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:05,333
Set him free.

918
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:09,666
When you're ready to take on Kazeem,

919
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:15,166
I have an army, we'll stand by you.

920
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:16,750
Understand?

921
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:24,125
You know I don't like you for shit,

922
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:28,000
but Kazeem's time is up.

923
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:32,916
Get up.

924
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:46,708
Alaye.

925
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:50,500
Eruku.

926
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,666
I'm sure Ifeanyi would have made it.

927
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:25,958
He had just recorded a new track
to perform that night.

928
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,291
I can’t believe he’s actually gone.

929
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,083
Omo aiye never brings harm to his own.
But they killed Ify.

930
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,250
What was his crime?

931
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,541
Pana who just wanted to have a good time.

932
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:58,125
They butchered him
like an animal in the streets.

933
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:08,125
I know Kazeem is insane,
but not with family.

934
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,833
And that fucking bastard Terrible!

935
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,000
Kazeem is not my family.

936
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:28,875
I’m going to kill them all.

937
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:34,916
They broke the rules so all bets are off.

938
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:41,125
Everyone who cut him,

939
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:47,416
held him down,
even those that watched.

940
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,583
I'll take revenge.

941
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,041
Even if it costs me my life,

942
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:02,375
I won’t stop till Kazeem is dead.

943
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:27,250
Move and I’ll blow your brains off!

944
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:32,291
What’s the meaning of this?!
How dare you?! Have you gone mad?

945
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:35,500
Rosy, come and take your money.

946
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,916
You’re part of this? You set me up?

947
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:44,958
If you want to kill him,
please don’t stain my sheets.

948
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,708
I have another customer coming.

949
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:47,958
Leave!

950
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:50,000
You! You set me up.

951
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:53,583
Help me. Help me!

952
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,458
Open your fucking mouth!

953
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:02,250
Please don’t kill me.

954
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:09,541
Please don’t kill me. Please.

955
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:11,791
Gift says you know where Kazeem
stores his shipment of weapons.

956
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:16,375
Yes, I know where it is.
It’s across the river.

957
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:24,375
Shut the fuck up!

958
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:27,916
Look at him. Fucking bastard!

959
01:43:29,791 --> 01:43:33,083
Come out here!

960
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:41,541
I'll blow your head off.

961
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:48,375
I'll blow your head off.

962
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,958
Who are you? What do you want...

963
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:48,125
Oba, what are we waiting for?

964
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:50,500
Let’s waste this motherfucker.

965
01:44:51,458 --> 01:44:57,250
Wait...
I know something you will want to know.

966
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:00,000
Oba, this snake is lying.

967
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:04,250
Terrible, speak, I’m listening.

968
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:09,250
I need your word you will have
mercy on me when I tell you this.

969
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:15,041
Oba, if you don’t kill this bastard,
I’ll kill him myself.

970
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:17,500
Ebun, Stand down.

971
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:21,041
Terrible, relax, you have my word.

972
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:26,708
I am sure you've heard the stories
about how loved your father was,

973
01:45:26,791 --> 01:45:30,583
but your father
didn't like Olorogun one bit.

974
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:36,916
He knew Olorogun wanted to
rule Lagos for his own selfish gains.

975
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:40,208
So he threw his weight behind
Bamidele's father.

976
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:41,583
Which Bamidele?

977
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,791
The one running for Governor?

978
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:46,458
Exactly.

979
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,666
Your father had a lot of influence

980
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:52,500
and everybody knew Olorogun
was going to lose the election.

981
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:58,333
That's where Kazeem and Olorogun's
unholy alliance was born.

982
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:02,333
It was then Olorogun
sent Kazeem to kill your father.

983
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,416
It was a bloodbath.

984
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:21,166
They killed Bamidele's father,
Ify's father

985
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:23,208
and anyone else
who was loyal to both of them.

986
01:46:25,708 --> 01:46:27,125
And Alaye Bam Bam?

987
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:29,666
Who do you think took Kazeem to Olorogun?

988
01:46:41,291 --> 01:46:43,250
For Pana.

989
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,708
Keep it down!

990
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:18,541
Hello?

991
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,375
Mummy, this is your son…

992
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:23,583
Oba.

993
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:27,416
Hello, mummy.

994
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:29,875
I don’t know that name.

995
01:48:32,833 --> 01:48:34,250
Mummy, it’s Akande.

996
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:35,833
I said I don’t know who you are.

997
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:37,708
Mummy, please don’t hang up.

998
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:43,208
You may never hear my voice again.

999
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:47,375
Mummy, I know those who killed my father.

1000
01:48:48,416 --> 01:48:50,000
I swear I’m going to kill…

1001
01:48:55,791 --> 01:48:56,916
Hello Mummy.

1002
01:52:43,166 --> 01:52:44,458
Teni!

1003
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:00,916
Traitor!

1004
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,791
Your day of reckoning has come.

1005
01:54:09,791 --> 01:54:10,750
It’s over.

1006
01:54:15,916 --> 01:54:21,666
Drop the gun and fight me like a man.

1007
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:26,333
I don’t need a gun to kill you.

1008
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:31,250
I’ll kill you with my bare hands.

1009
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:35,250
You silly little boy.

1010
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:39,375
You really think you can defeat me.

1011
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,041
- You killed my father.
- Your father was a fool.

1012
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:47,041
A fool who wanted to give up everything
so the people would love him.

1013
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:48,500
Well, nobody loves you.

1014
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,291
I don't need their love.

1015
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:54,500
I'm a leader.

1016
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,583
A leader does what is necessary.

1017
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:53,875
Silly boy.

1018
01:55:55,458 --> 01:55:58,416
You don't have what it takes

1019
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,833
to seek revenge yet.

1020
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:33,041
You've killed all my loved ones.

1021
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:35,208
All because you want to rule Lagos.

1022
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:38,291
- My son please.
- I'm not your son.

1023
01:56:40,958 --> 01:56:42,208
Butcher’s son.

1024
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:44,291
Gangster.

1025
01:56:44,583 --> 01:56:45,750
Thug.

1026
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:47,666
Street rat.

1027
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,041
There’s nothing I haven’t been called.

1028
01:57:02,291 --> 01:57:05,250
Well, this butcher’s son
is going to rule over Lagos.

1029
01:57:14,375 --> 01:57:16,166
So it wasn’t London,

1030
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:24,041
it was you who killed Nino.

1031
01:57:24,916 --> 01:57:26,333
You’re such a disappointment.

1032
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:30,708
I’ve always thought you had
what it took for greatness.

1033
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:32,583
That you had the courage,

1034
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:39,000
I thought you had plans to be
Eleniyan like me.

1035
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:43,458
But you’re just like your father.

1036
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,625
Send my regards when you get to heaven.

1037
01:58:03,291 --> 01:58:06,125
Greet them yourself.

1038
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:47,041
Kadara...

1039
02:00:56,875 --> 02:00:57,833
Oba.

1040
02:00:59,041 --> 02:01:00,416
This is your face.

1041
02:01:01,708 --> 02:01:02,875
My Governor.

1042
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:06,583
In nine months.

1043
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:14,000
They can’t stop it.

1044
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:15,416
Not in this lifetime!
